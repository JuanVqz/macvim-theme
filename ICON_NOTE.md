# Icon Note

Before publishing, you need to add an `icon.png` file to the root of this extension.

## Requirements

- **Size**: 128x128 pixels (recommended)
- **Format**: PNG
- **Content**: A square icon representing the MacVim theme

## Creating an Icon

You can:
1. Create a simple icon using any image editor
2. Use a MacVim-inspired design
3. Keep it simple and recognizable

The icon will be displayed in the VS Code Marketplace and in the Extensions view.

## Temporary Solution

If you don't have an icon ready, you can temporarily remove the `"icon": "icon.png"` line from `package.json`, but having an icon is recommended for better visibility in the marketplace.
